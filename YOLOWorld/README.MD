# 🚀 Traffic Counting with YOLOWorld 🚘

Welcome to the Traffic Counting with YOLOWorld project! This project uses the powerful YOLOWorld model from Ultralytics to detect and count various objects in images and videos, with a focus on traffic-related objects like cars, bikes, trucks, and more.

## 🌟 Features

- 💥 Utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOWorld model for object detection
- 🖼️ Supports image and video processing
- 🚗 Customizable object classes for traffic-related objects
- 📹 Real-time video processing with annotated object detection
- 🚀 Leverages the Ultralytics and Supervision libraries for a smooth experience

## 🚀 Getting Started
