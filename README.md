# 🚥 Traffic Optimization for Bangalore Roads 🚗

Welcome to the Traffic Optimization for Bangalore Roads project! This repository contains all the code, websites, and underlying backend code to help optimize traffic flow in the bustling streets of Bangalore. Get ready to embark on a journey through the world of urban traffic management!

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Signal Optimization**: This folder contains the network of roads in Bangalore, created using SUMO and OpenStreetMap data. It's where the magic happens for training the neural network to optimize traffic conditions in the city.

- **Next.js App**: This project is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered applications. Here, you'll find the code for the frontend and backend components of the application.
